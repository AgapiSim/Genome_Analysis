# Genome_Analysis

The analysis in the present repository is part of the MSc course Genome Analysis (1MB462) at Uppsala University.

The main idea is to reproduce some of the basic analysis steps realized in the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-017-4299-9) "RNA-seq and Tn-seq reveal fitness determinants of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium during growth in human serum" by X. Zhang et. al. 2017.

_For a detailed guide on the on-going project look on the repository's GitHub [wiki](https://github.com/AgapiSim/Genome_Analysis/wiki)._
